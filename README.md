#  AI and Kernel Influences: A Study on Improving Energy Forecasting Accuracy
The "AI and Kernel Influences: A Study on Improving Energy Forecasting Accuracy" project into cutting-edge machine learning methodologies for predicting short-term energy needs. Central to this study is an LSTM-based HyperNetwork model, designed to enhance forecasting precision by utilizing advanced Kernel analysis. 
This approach is benchmarked against leading models like MLPs, RNNs, and Transformers for comparative analysis. 
Key components of the project include:
1. **Model Customization**: Customize any model within the `training.py` file by utilizing the model architectures outlined in `model.py`.
2. **Comprehensive Model Repository**: All model architectures are systematically organized in the `models` directory.
3. **Results and Analysis**: Detailed performance metrics and analyses are stored in the `Testing` directory, facilitating easy evaluation of models.
